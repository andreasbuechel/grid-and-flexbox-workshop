# Grid & Flexbox

## [THEME]

## Objectives

- Use flexbox to create horizontal and vertical layouts.
- Use grid to create 2D layouts.
- Use grid to create rigid horizontal and vertical layouts.
- Nest flexbox containers to create 2D layouts.
- Use the styled components library to limit the cascade.

## Why?

Layout is complicated, and the more creative your layouts get, the more thoughtful you have to be about

## Setup

This is a standard react project - run `npm run start` or our standard `npm run play` to start the lab.

## Framing

We're building a task-layout board - we're going to do it all - Kanban Boards, Tables, Tiles, and maybe even a Gantt chart if there's time.

## Exercises

### 1. Make the menu bar

### 2. Make the table

### 3. Make the card grid

### 4. Make the individual cards

### 5. Make the Kanban board

### 6. Make the Gantt chart
